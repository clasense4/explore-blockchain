# Explore Javascript, Typescript and Blockchain

## Introduction

This repository is about exploring Vanilla Javascript and Blockchain with Typescript.

## Requirements

[Docker](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-20-04) needs to be available.

```bash
‚ùØ docker --version
Docker version 20.10.6, build 370c289
```

## Up & Running

I have provided a Makefile to install the project and running the script.

```bash
$ make
bash                 Run bash inside the docker image
help                 Show this help
install              Build the Docker image and install NPM packages
problem1             Run the Problem 1: Three ways to sum to n
problem3             Run the Problem 3: Datasource Connector Tool
problem4             Run the Problem 4: Interacting with Chain

# Build the Docker image and install NPM packages
make install

# Run the Problem 1: Three ways to sum to n
make problem1

Three ways to sum to n
Using a simple for loop: 15
Using a Formula: 15
Using a Recursive Function: 15

# Run the Problem 3: Datasource Connector Tool
make problem3

# Run the Problem 4: Interacting with Chain
# Prepare the BSC_RPC_URL by folowing the guide at: https://docs.moralis.io/speedy-nodes/connecting-to-rpc-nodes/connect-to-bsc-node
# Export the RPC URL from the previous step as environment variable
export BSC_RPC_URL=https://...

# Example output
make problem4
